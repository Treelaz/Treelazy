# Treelazy
## A programming waste who is idle and achieves nothing.
## A mediocre university animal.
## I like to read the code of big shots, and I also hope to become a big shot. I hope big shots can catch me
## I like programming, but I'm not very smart (naturally stupid), don't mind.
## The code I wrote is a pile of shit, please don't spray it too hard!
